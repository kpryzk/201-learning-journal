Another day of group programming!

Yesterday was good and fun, I am feeling pretty good about the way the website looks and am excited to work out all the small issues and discuss the presentation. As far as MVP, the website totally works, but we definitely still need to troubleshoot. Yesterday I learned that em is difficult to use without a conversion chart and that px are much more intuitive to me, so I ended up doing a lot of immediate work in px and then later converted them. I think it is best practice to use them? w/e.
