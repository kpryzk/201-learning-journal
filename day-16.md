# Learning Journal: Class 9

Today was more JS on the group project, more coffee, more whiteboarding, more trying to rein in individual work on group project, more traffic. I THINK I am happy with where we are in our progress on the project, but tomorrow is CSS and I feel like it is going to be harder to reach consensus on that than it will be on code that is less flexible.

It's honestly been a while since I've had to maintain a 9-6 (or, like, 5-8) schedule and as much as I complain, it is kind of nice to know what I am doing with my day? Wake up, drink a protein shake, eat vitamins, drive to the train station, sit on a train for an hour, take a bus for 20 minutes, arrive at 8:30am, etc. like one of those movie montages that's supposed to show the dull repetition of a main character about to do something worthy of a movie. Contrast to before when I woke up every day not knowing how long I could stay in the country, or where I was going to end up, or what was going to happen and "dull repetition" actually just feels like a nice reset on what was becoming an over-complicated stress.

Still, though, really looking forward to next week.
