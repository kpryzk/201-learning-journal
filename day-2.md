# Learning Journal: Day 2

In yesterday's draft, I wrote about how the room was very cold, so when the opportunity to go outside for lunch arose, I was happy to take a little longer and enjoy summer warmth in Seattle. I felt very indulgent and cocky. By the time I got back to the Code Fellows building, everyone was well into their About Me lab. I'd read the directions and had a pretty good idea of how to enact the JS code, so I sat down, got to work, and pounded out that portion relatively quickly, with the help of Google. Half the battle is knowing what to look up, though, right?

I ran into trouble with an "OR" statement, so instead of:
if(prompt.toUpperCase() === 'YES' || 'Y')

I had to write:
if(prompt.toUpperCase() === 'YES' || prompt.toUpperCase() === 'Y')

and I truly do not understand why, and neither did Hawa. I will have to ask about that! I spent about 15 minutes going through and dismantling the code until I narrowed the problem down to that line, and then was able to ask about it. I think maybe I felt frustrated that I had to dismantle it again in front of someone when I was already confident of the source of the issue, which is something I should get used to!

Before I left the class, I threw up some basic CSS, pushed the rough draft to GitHub, and asked a TA if I had the basic idea down. Then I headed home, beginning my long night of obsessing over margins and padding.

I could spend days tuning a CSS stylesheet - in part because I know what I want something to look like and am a perfectionist, and in larger part because I don't actually know what I am doing or what exactly anything does, so it takes me 2-3x as long as it probably should. By the time I got things to a reasonable level of acceptability (MVP) I was mentally exhausted and had no idea what to write about myself.

Also, I am incredibly self-conscious about my lacking work and educational background, so it's like... difficult for me to casually enter information about myself. I felt much less indulgent and cocky by the time I got to bed - much later than I should've considering I have to wake up at 5am. And now I am on a train feeling very sleepy and writing paragraphs.
