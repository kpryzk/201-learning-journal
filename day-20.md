# Learning Journal 20

I learned that Les Schwab has wifi as I am currently waiting on a flat tire to be changed. I learned that practice makes perfect and therefore our presentation was imperfect, but also who cares because it is done. I learned that Austin has an amazing view from his rooftop. I learned that having an audience member comment on/compliment something that I worked heavily on feels nice and does at least a little to get rid of imposter syndrome. I learned that there are free t-shirts, and that there should always be coffee available. I learned that most of the people I like and care about in class are continuing on to 301 and I am excited to learn more along with them. Also I learned that Les Schwab's coffee tastes like tires and I am unsure if it is environmental or intentional.
