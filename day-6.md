# Learning Journal: Day 6

I am so, so tired today?

I'm not sure if this is the right kind of imposter syndrome, but I was surprised by how quickly I knocked out the general outline of the challenge yesterday. I feel like I was just copying things from the examples given in class and also from the corgi thing? Like, filling in the blanks with stuff that I needed instead of the example info, and then the things generally ran, and then it was a matter of getting the correct syntax to shove it into a literal object. I guess other people had the same notes to copy from, but maybe they are challenging themselves to not use those things, and I am falling behind from my lack of in-depth understanding? Being able to follow directions isn't the same thing as actually knowing something, and I am worried that once I get to harder things without explicit instructions, I will implode.

Also, this commute is the worst - I am out of the house for 14 hours, and only have 2 hours at home before I have to get to sleep for 7 hours, repeat daily. I also don't have anyone to complain about that to, as I'm living alone under an increasingly large pile of laundry.

But that isn't about coding. I feel like today is going to be hard for reasons outside of the actual material... as well as the actual material itself.
