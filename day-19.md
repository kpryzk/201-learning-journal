# Learning Journal 19

Hi, Brandon! It's the last day of 201 and I am really happy that I have a week off to like... learn Javascript... but on my own time! Maybe sitting under a tree. Maybe with a cider or a whiskey soda in a tall glass with bitters. Hopefully you'll still be available on Slack to answer all of my questions. (kidding!)

Seriously, though, thank you so much for your help over the past month and (kinda more importantly) your support and kind words and positive responses to my projects. Your encouragement was truly so important, and helped me not have a complete mental breakdown when I was sleepy and stuck in traffic and didn't want to come to class. You are an excellent mentor - you are really good at both knowing the answer to every question, and also forcing me to come up with those answers on my own with helpful hints. You're the best!

Also, I am tired and have learned too much to recount all the things I've learned... but there are a lot of them!
