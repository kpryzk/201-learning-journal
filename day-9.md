# Learning Journal: Day 2

Sleep is so great!

I am feeling pretty okay about this week - I was able to complete the labs the days they were due, have created a reasonably attractive CSS site, and feel like I have a pretty good understanding of what I am doing. I think?! It is cool that things I had to think really hard about a week ago feel like second nature now - basic JS syntax and ACP to GitHub and quick HTML frames, etc. It's nice to experience that kind of growth in a short time and see noticeable differences in my abilities; that said, the more I learn, the more I KNOW that I don't know yet, so it is easy to also feel like I will never fully "get" it.

I think the biggest challenges for me right now are figuring out how to order things in JS, when to call functions, & whether variables should be global and if so when and where to reassign them. Also I really need to figure out a better way of testing my code. On Wednesday I wasted a lot of time trying to mock up a simplified version of the code that kept failing, but once I shoved the same thing into my existing framework it worked reasonably okay. I need to lean more heavily on the console and console logs and calling things in the console so I can actually see that the code I've written exists in some way before it appears on the screen.
