# Day 15 Journal

I am feeling so much more positive after finishing the 301 entrance exam (not great, but passing!) and the reading assignments that have been hanging over my head - and I actually did read everything, spending my weekend sitting outside as much as the heat would allow and reading books and articles about CSS and local storage like an immense nerd. I also have been exchanging messages on Slack with the people in my group project - nothing really about the project, but encouragement for the final and and like... casual conversation about the weather, which I find very charming and hopefully a good sign that next week will go reasonably well.

I am just going to repost the pep talk my friend gave me about my imposter syndrome in not knowing how to write nice codes here: 
here's how I justify it to myself, maybe it'll help you, maybe not. even as a beginner
but software is much less a science than it is an art. as a ~software engineer~ you're tasked with solving problems, so you put the pieces together in a way that makes sense. but only a small part of it is actually writing code - the rest is about communicating with stakeholders, or writing good documents, or thinking about solutions
annnnd so many of those solutions are "new" (give or take, given the tools you have)
so it's no wonder that it's broken 50% of the time. so you google, and band-aid the problems until you have a thing that does what you need.
code itself is a liability. you should try to write as little as possible. the _value_ you provide is the shipped product for the customer/user...so fucking hack that code, google the errors, and get the code out into the world!
(I think where I find comfort is finding tools I like (even the right laptop, but also the software I use, with the right colours/shortcuts/etc), and maintaining good process (even if part of that process is "step 1: google the problem"). between those two I feel confident tackling new problems)
honestly, learning syntax is a fool's errand
it'll make more sense later (when you're using more advanced tools), but when you can have tools tell you when you've made syntax errors (and, ideally, they suggest the fix) then you're saving yourself so much cognitive weight
so then you're freed up to think about solving the actual business problem
I fuck up syntax shit _ALL THE TIME_.. or just like, forgetting the order of arguments. is it $('something).css('foo', 'bar') or $('something).style({ 'foo': 'bar'}) or WHAT
and then, having tools that help find the documentation in a hurry (mostly that is just google though)
