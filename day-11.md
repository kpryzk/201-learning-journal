# Learning Journal: Day 11

NOPE!

Like, no. I am just at a loss for how little I did today and how I couldn't pull it together enough to figure out a plan and enact it in order to get at least a semblance of code running and I am just... feeling really rotten about my lack of progress or ability to step back and wrap my head around things today.

 After I trekked off to get a Diet Coke, I sat back down to a group of people in another class very loudly discussing -insert current sociopolitical topic I care deeply about here-. Whatever, everyone is coming in here with different experiences and beliefs, but I also felt like it was ~not great~ for the conversation to (again, very loudly) continue as it had for several minutes. I turned and asked if they could keep it down because what they were saying was (if nothing else) controversial - and there's that whole thing about leaving politics at the door - so big conversations were probably best for private times vs. common areas. In response they, uh, aggressively "welcomed" my opinion - "we're JUST TALKING about it, you can FEEL FREE to join the conversation if you disagree!" I responded that, nah, I was just trying to work on a project... but then I spent the rest of the day feeling shaky and wired and uncomfortable and TOOO DELICATE FOR THE WORLD because as much as I try to leave my personal beliefs at the door (and feel like I do so successfully within our nice, friendly class), it is hard when those beliefs are a big part of how I interact with the world. I feel like I did the right thing by suggesting that it wasn't an appropriate topic for the environment instead of engaging in a debate, but it didn't help the shakiness and discomfort.

It all sounds like a pile of excuses, but after that my brain felt it was a much better idea to crawl under a desk or a bed instead of trying to focus on the empty arrays that I need to push numbers into in order to cycle through photos at random without direct repetition.  

Part of my necessary learning process is toughening up, I guess. I just feel so disappointed in myself on top of it all.
