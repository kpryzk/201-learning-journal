# Journal Day 13

I can't get buttons to work and my page is very ugly, albeit functional. This project bummed me out on many levels as it felt like a bad kind of challenge over and over, PROBABLY because I got a really late start on it and missed a day of work.

Wah. I should write about actual code here.
